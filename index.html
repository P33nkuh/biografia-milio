        Milio, new League of Legends champion      
    </h1>
    <h2>
        Master of the Fire Axiom
    </h2>
    <p>
At just 12 years old, Milio has impressive control over the fire axiom, possessing rare abilities for any citizen of Ixtal, much less someone his age. Where most Ixtali study for a lifetime to understand the Axiomata—an intricate, rigid, near-mathematical system of elemental magic—Milio has an inherent understanding of his powers, and that he must use them for good.

Fire as a power source typically calls to mind offensive spells that burn and scorch. But the soft glow of Milio’s healing flame is a far cry from the aggressive fireballs of champions like Brand or Annie.

Milio’s kit is all about using fire to heal and empower his allies, with help from the giant, bulbous fuemigo that’s cozied up in his backpack.
